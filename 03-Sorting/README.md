# Sorting Algorithms in Java

## Overview

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order, usually **ascending** or **descending**.

Sorting improves the efficiency of searching, data processing, and many other algorithms.

This folder contains implementations of the most fundamental sorting algorithms in Java.

# Bubble Sort

## What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Characteristics

- Simple to understand
- Stable sorting algorithm
- In-place sorting
- Suitable for small datasets

### Time Complexity

| Case | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Best | O(n) *(Optimized)* |
| Average | O(n²) |
| Worst | O(n²) |

### Space Complexity

```
O(1)
```

# Selection Sort

## What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it in its correct position.

### Characteristics

- Simple implementation
- In-place sorting
- Performs fewer swaps than Bubble Sort
- Not stable by default

### Time Complexity

| Case | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Best | O(n²) |
| Average | O(n²) |
| Worst | O(n²) |

### Space Complexity

```
O(1)
```

---

# Insertion Sort

## What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

### Characteristics

- Stable sorting algorithm
- In-place sorting
- Efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets

### Time Complexity

| Case | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Best | O(n) |
| Average | O(n²) |
| Worst | O(n²) |

### Space Complexity

```
O(1)
```

# Quick Sort

## What is Quick Sort?

Quick Sort is a **divide-and-conquer** sorting algorithm that selects a **pivot** element and partitions the array into two parts.

### Characteristics

- Very fast in practice
- Recursive algorithm
- In-place sorting
- Performance depends on pivot selection

### Time Complexity

| Case | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Best | O(n log n) |
| Average | O(n log n) |
| Worst | O(n²) |

### Space Complexity

| Case | Complexity |
|------|------------|
| Average | O(log n) |
| Worst | O(n) |
